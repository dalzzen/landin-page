                here under the main title. It's a smaller
                font and the color is lower contrast.

                This is an inspiring quote, or a 
                testimonial from a customer. Maybe 
                it's just filling up space, or maybe 
                people will actually read it. Who knows? 
                All i know is that it looks nice.
